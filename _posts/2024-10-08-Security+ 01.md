# Security+ 701

## 1.0 General Security Concepts

#### 1.1 Compare and contrast various types of security controls.

Categories help organize security policies and controls into boxes.
Controls are the specific techniques to achieve the security goals
- Categories
-**Technical:** Technologies from hardware to software that help reduce risk. Firewall rules or Access Control Lists
-**Managerial:** Administrative functions and security policies to secure system. Risk assessments or change management
-**Operational:** Day to day operations for security policies implemented by people specifically. Log monitoring or vulnerability management
-**Physical:** Physical objects that provide security. Things you can touch like fences or locks

- Control Types
-**Preventive:** Things that prevent an incident from happening
-**Deterrent:** Deter away incidents from happeneing
-**Detective:** Detect incidents that already happened
-**Corrective:** Fix or restore operations to normal after a incident
-**Compensating:** Alternative controls when normal is not available
-**Directive:** Specific instructions on how to handle incidents

#### 1.2 Summarize fundamental security concepts.

**CIA Triad**: 3 pillars that guide security policies
- **Confidentiality:** Prevent unauthorized access to information
- **Integrity:** Prevent unauthorized changes to information
- **Availability:** Ensure access to information when needed

**Non-repudiation:** You can't take back actions or the responsibility for them
**AAA:** Access Management System
- **Authentication:** Prove or verify an identity
- **Authorization:** Checks if the user is authorized to that resource
- **Accounting:** Track user activity and logs

**Gap analysis:** An assessment comparing the current policies implemented against a standard or goal they want to meet. The gaps are areas that they don't meet.

**Zero Trust:** By default don't trust any device and require verification even if they are already in the network/system. It uses **Adaptive Identity** authentication instead, which is it changes the way it requires authentication based on the requests context and factors.

**Control Plane:** The area where actions, decisions or policies are controlled
- **Policy-driven access control:** Policies and business roles are used to determine access
- **Policy Engine:** Creates the decision to grant access based on defined policies 
- **Policy Administrator:** Communicates the decision made from PE to the enforcement known as PEP
**Data Plane:** The area of communication on the network and processing of network data
- **Policy Enforcement Point:** Tools that enforce the decision made by the PDP

**Physical Security:** 
- Bollards: Poles used to stop vehicles
- Access control vestibule: Small space between 2 sets of doors to make manage access control into rooms
- Fencing: Set around the perimeter to keep people out of an area
- Video surveillance: Security Cameras monitor areas of interest
- Security guard: A person whose duties are to ensure the securitry of the building
- Access badge: A badge containing credentials to gain access
- Lighting: A light source to reveal people in areas
- Sensors: 
-- Infrared: Detect Heat signatures
-- Pressure: Detect when someone is walking through pressure plates
-- Microwave: Detects movement
-- Ultrasonic: Uses soundwaves to detect presence

**HoneyPot:** Intentional vulnerable server to bait attackers
**HoneyNet:** Multiple honeypots on a separate network
**Honeyfile:** A file used to bait attackers
**HoneyToken:** A token used to identify if a hacker has access or used it

#### 1.3 Explain the importance of change management processes and the impact to security.
- **Approval process:** Ensures every change and step is reviewed and cleared
- **Ownership:** Labels who is responsible for every change
- **Stakeholders:** People who would be impacted by the changes
- **Impact analysis:** The impact and effects of a change
- **Test results:** Confirm that the change works as expected
- **Backout plan:** A plan for reverting the change if something is wrong
- **Maintenance window:** A planned window of time where the system is down for maintenance
- **Standard operating procedure:** Instructions to complete specific tasks or handle incidents

**Technical implications:**
- **Allow lists/deny lists:** A list of allowed or denied entities
- **Restricted activities:** Limited or restricted activities for security reasons
- **Downtime:** A timeframe where a system is down
- **Service restart:** Restarting a service to fix an issue or change
- **Application restart:** Restarting a application for change
- **Legacy applications:** Outdated applications that aren't supported anymore
- **Dependencies:** Components that depend on another component

**Documentation:** Updating policies or diagrams for security changes
**Version Control:** Tracks changes made to code or documents

#### 1.4 Explain the importance of using appropriate cryptographic solutions

- **Public key:** A shared key used in asymmetric encryption
- **Private key:** A secret key used in asymmetric encryption
- **Key escrow:** A trusted third party that holds private keys for backup

 
- **Level**
-**Full-disk** The entire disk is encrypted
-**Partition** A part of the disk is encrypted
-**File** A specific file is encrypted
-**Volume** Made up of disks encrypted
-**Database** Used to secure tables of information
-**Record** a specific encrypted record in a database
- **Transport/communication** information is encryted using TLS during transmission
- **Asymmetric** uses a public and private key
- **Symmetric** uses the same single key for both encryt and decrypt
- **Key exchange** Exchanging keys without it being intercepted
- **Algorithms** Math formulas that create encryptions
- **Key length** The size of a key, the longer the stronger

**Trusted Platform Module (TPM)** A chip on the motherboard to create and store cytopgraphic functions
**Hardware security module (HSM)** A device to manage and store keys
**Key management system** A centralized system to manage keys
**Secure enclave** isolated section of the chip or CPU
**Obfuscation** Techniquest to make reverse engineering difficult
**Steganography** Hide informatoin in a media
**Tokenization** Replace characters with different token
**Data masking** Replaces characters with the same mask (***)
**Hashing** Converts data into a fixed length hash
**Salting** Adds random data to the end of a data to prevent rainbow tables
**Digital signatures** An encryption to verify the integrity of the data
**Key stretching** Encrypts multiple times to prevent brute force
**Blockchain** A ledger recording transactions to a ledger
**Open public ledger** A public ledger that everyone can read or write

**Certificates**
**Certificate authorities** Trusted authority to validate and sign certificates
**Certificate revocation lists(CRLs)** A list of certificates that are revoked
**Online Certificate StatusProtocol (OCSP)** A protocol to check certificate status
**Self-signed** Certificates signed by the company itself for personal use
**Third-party** Certificates signed by a trusted thirdparty
**Root of trust** The structure of trust, the root CA signs other certificates
